# Welcome to my homepage!

Hi, Iâ€™m **Debarshi**, a 5th-year Integrated BS-MS student in Physical Sciences at **IISER Berhampur**. This is my personal homepage.

## Research Interests
I am passionate about various disciplines of astrophysics and cosmology. I'm particularly interested in studies of CMB(Cosmic Micorwave Background) and early universe cosmology. Except that, I have interest in studying High energy astrophysics, related to study if Blazars and Pulsars. I love to explore astrophysical phenomenon in compact objects and also to study about dark matter astroparticle physics. I want to explore the application of machine learning in study of different astrophysical phenomenons.
