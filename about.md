# About Me

I'm Debarshi, a 5th-year student at pursuing a BS-MS dual degree at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER) Berhampur**. I am majoring in Physical Sciences. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's Thesis in Cosmology under the supervision of **Prof. Tarun Souradeep** at the **Ramana Research Institute(RRI)** on the topic of **Cosmic Microwave Background**.

Apart from physics, I also enjoy doing photography and videography, I run an own photography page and have participated in many competitions. I was one of the founding member of the videography club of my college. Besides physics and photography, I love to write story, play guitar and read history. I have been a core committee member of the physics club of my college.
