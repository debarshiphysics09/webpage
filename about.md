# About Me

I'm Debarshi, a 5th-year student at pursuing a BS-MS dual degree at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER) Berhampur**. I am majoring in Physical Sciences. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's Thesis in Cosmology under the supervision of **Prof. Tarun Souradeep** at the **Raman Research Institute(RRI)** on the topic of **Cosmic Microwave Background**.

Apart from physics, I also enjoy doing photography and videography, I run an own photography page and have participated in many competitions. I was one of the founding member of the videography club of my college. Besides physics and photography, I love to write story, play guitar and read history. I have been a core committee member of the physics club of my college.

## Research Interests
I am passionate about various disciplines of astrophysics and cosmology. I'm particularly interested in studies of CMB(Cosmic Micorwave Background) and early universe cosmology. Except that, I have interest in studying High energy astrophysics, related to study if Blazars and Pulsars. I love to explore astrophysical phenomenon in compact objects and also to study about dark matter astroparticle physics. I want to explore the application of machine learning in study of different astrophysical phenomenons.
