# Projects

Here are a few projects Iâ€™ve worked on during my time at IISER Berhampur.

### ðŸŒ€ Summer project on "Long-term Fermi-LAT data analysis of the GeV blazar OP313 from November 2023 till May 2024" 
**Duration:**June 2024 â€“ July 2024 
**Guide:** Dr. Pratik Majuder, Department of High Energy Astrophysics, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics
**Description:**  
Study of the emission of blazar OP313 in this time period in high energy gamma ray wavelength from the Fermi_LAT data. Using tools liks Fermipy, we plotted the lightcurves and SED(spectral energy distribution) plots to understand the emission. Currently we are trying to model the blazar to explain the emission mechanism.
